# TEST PROMPT — Build a Headless Lineage 2 Auto-Login Client (Node.js 24.15.0 + TypeScript)

> **This whole file is a single prompt.** Copy everything below the line and give it to any LLM.
> The LLM must produce a working project. The only success goal: **a character automatically
> connects, authenticates, enters the game world, and stays connected (answers server pings)**.
>
> This prompt is deliberately self-contained: every opcode, byte layout, and crypto routine you
> need is included inline. Do **not** invent values — use only what is written here.
>
> **Game-server encryption is flag-driven.** Apply the 16-byte shifting XOR cipher only when
> CryptInit reports a non-zero flag; when the flag is `0`, the stream is plaintext. Honor whatever
> flag the server sends — do not hard-code encryption on or off.
>
> **Verified against implementation.** This prompt has been reconciled with a working TypeScript
> implementation. Code snippets, opcode values, packet layouts, and state-machine behavior reflect what the
> reference source actually does, including edge cases such as skipped `GGAuth`, skipped
> `CharSelected`, server-side extended opcodes (`0xFE`), and the exact `Connection.send()` contract.
>
> **PROMPT VERSION 3.** Version 2 pinned the module format (`"type": "module"` + explicit `.ts`
> extensions in relative imports — version 1 did not run), added `## PACKET PIPELINE` and
> `## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS`, and replaced the tautological crypto round-trips with known-answer
> vectors. This revision closes the gaps that made an otherwise *correct* implementation fail
> anyway: the `import type` requirement of `verbatimModuleSyntax`, the one allowed
> `login/ → game/Opcodes.ts` import, the `UserInfo`-before-`CharSelected` dead end, a runnable
> crypto gate (`npm run selftest`), the `CryptInit` byte layout, unknown-packet and
> per-state-timer semantics, ping handling in every state, and an optional `L2_GAME_IP` override.
> Clients generated from versions 1 and 2 of this prompt are not directly comparable with version 3.

## ROLE & GOAL

You are a senior TypeScript network engineer. Build a small, headless **Lineage 2 game client**
that targets a **HighFive** server (protocol `267`).

The program must, with **no human interaction**:

1. Connect to the **Login Server** over TCP, authenticate with a username/password, pick a game
   server from the server list, and obtain session keys.
2. Connect to the **Game Server** over TCP, authenticate with those session keys, select a
   character by slot index, and **enter the world**.
3. Print `IN_GAME` to the console when the character is in the world.
4. **Keep the connection alive**: when the server sends a ping, reply with a pong. Stay connected.

**Definition of done:** running `npm run dev` connects end-to-end against a real server, logs
`IN_GAME`, keeps answering pings for at least 60 seconds without crashing, and `npx tsc --noEmit`
reports no type errors.

### Out of scope (do NOT build these)

No REST API, no WebSocket server, no web dashboard, no combat, no movement, no inventory logic,
no database, no dependency-injection framework. Keep it small and single-purpose. One small class
per file is fine. All code comments in English.

---

## HARD CONSTRAINTS (read carefully — most failures come from breaking these)

1. **Node.js 24.15.0**, **TypeScript** (strict mode on).
2. **All integers are little-endian.**
3. **Packet framing:** every packet on the wire is `[uint16LE size][1-byte opcode][payload...]`.
   The 2-byte size field **includes itself**. Example: a 5-byte packet has size `0x0005`.
4. **Strings are UTF-16LE, null-terminated** (two `0x00` bytes terminator), unless stated otherwise.
5. **Extended packets:** a client extended packet is `[0xD0][2-byte sub-opcode LE][payload]` — the
   sub-opcode is a `uint16LE`, **not** a byte, however small its value. `RequestKeyMapping` has
   sub-opcode `0x0021` and is still sent as `0xD0 0x0021`; it is the only extended packet this
   client sends. The server sends its own extended packets prefixed with `0xFE`: read the 2-byte
   sub-opcode that follows and dispatch accordingly (`0xFE 0x00D3` = `NetPingRequest`).
6. **Use the opcodes from the OPCODE MAP below — never the "textbook" L2 opcodes.** This server
   uses its own opcode set, confirmed by packet captures.
7. **Login uses crypto; game crypto is flag-driven.** Login Server: Blowfish ECB + RSA + XOR
   checksum (always on). Game Server: after `CryptInit` (`0x2E`), read `encryptionFlag`. If `flag != 0`,
   enable the 16-byte shifting XOR cipher and apply it to every subsequent sent/received body; if
   `flag == 0`, the stream is plaintext. The first game packet (`ProtocolVersion 0x0E`) is always
   sent raw. Honor the flag — never hard-code encryption on or off.
8. Never block the event loop. Use Node's `net` module with proper TCP stream reassembly.
9. **One pipeline, and every wait is bounded.** Turning a received frame into parsed fields and a
   reply into bytes follows the single path in `## PACKET PIPELINE`; no state waits forever
   (`## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS`). A run that hangs is a bug in the client, not a slow server.

### `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "l2-headless-client",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",

```

> **Runner: native TypeScript, no `ts-node`.** Node 24 strips types itself — `npm run dev` runs
> `src/index.ts` directly. Because this is plain type-stripping (not a full transform), the code
> **must avoid TS syntax that emits runtime code**: no `enum`, no `namespace`, no
> constructor parameter-properties (`constructor(private x: T)`) — declare fields in the class body
> and assign in the constructor. `Opcodes.ts` is a `const … as const` object, never an `enum`.
> `tsconfig.json` sets `"isolatedModules": true` so `tsc` flags any of these before runtime.
> Dependency versions are **pinned exact** (no `^`) so `tsc` behaves identically across runs.
>
> **Module format is not negotiable, and both halves must match.** `"type": "module"` plus
> **explicit `.ts` extensions on every relative import** (`import { … } from "./Blowfish.ts"`) is
> the only combination Node 24 actually runs. The alternatives fail before a single byte reaches
> the wire: under `"type": "commonjs"` an ESM `import` is `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement
> outside a module`, and under `"type": "module"` an extensionless relative import is
> `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. `node:` specifiers keep no extension. `tsc` accepts the `.ts` specifiers
> through `allowImportingTsExtensions` and rewrites them to `.js` in `dist/` through
> `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`, so `npm run build` + `npm start` keep working.

### `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "module": "nodenext",
    "moduleResolution": "nodenext",

    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"]
}
```

> `strict` is on but **`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is deliberately off**. The verbatim crypto uses
> non-null assertions (`this.S0[i]!`) that are correct as written under this config — do not remove
> them and do not enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` (it would force `undefined` handling into every
> reader/writer and add errors). `isolatedModules` + `skipLibCheck` keep the typecheck fast and
> aligned with the native-TS runner.
>
> **`verbatimModuleSyntax` makes type imports mandatory — this is the most common way a first
> `tsc` pass fails.** `src/types.ts` exports *only* types, so a value import of anything from it
> is a hard error: `TS1484: 'Config' is a type and must be imported using a type-only import when
> 'verbatimModuleSyntax' is enabled`. Every module that needs a shared type writes the `type`
> keyword — it is not optional:
>
> ```typescript
> import type { Config, LoginResult, Artifacts } from "../types.ts";  // correct
> import { Config } from "../types.ts";                               // TS1484, build fails
> ```
>
> A module that needs both a value and a type uses two statements:
> `import { OPCODES } from "./Opcodes.ts";` plus
> `import type { GameInput } from "../types.ts";`. This applies to `config.ts`, `index.ts`,
> `login/LoginClient.ts`, `game/GameClient.ts` and `debug/DebugTools.ts` alike.

### `.env.example`

```bash
L2_LOGIN_IP=192.168.0.33     # Login server IP
L2_LOGIN_PORT=2106        # Login server port
L2_GAME_PORT=7777         # Game server port (host comes from the server list)
#L2_GAME_IP=              # OPTIONAL. Set only to override the host from the server list
L2_USERNAME=qwerty          # Account login (max 14 chars)
L2_PASSWORD=qwerty          # Account password (max 16 chars)
L2_SERVER_ID=2            # Server id to pick from the login server list
L2_CHAR_SLOT=0            # Character slot index (0-based)
L2_PROTOCOL=267           # HighFive protocol (this prompt targets 267 only)
```

`config.ts` exports `loadConfig(): Config` (type from `src/types.ts`): loads these via `dotenv`,
converts numbers with `parseInt`, and throws a clear error if any required value is missing.
`L2_GAME_IP` is the **only** optional variable — absent or empty means "not set", and that is the
normal case; every other variable missing is an error. Write
`.env.example` as the template; **`.env` itself already exists with real credentials — read it,
never write it.** The inline comments above belong to the example file only.

### Entry point (`index.ts`)

There are no build phases and no `PHASE` environment variable. `index.ts` is a single linear
program: running `npm run dev` executes the whole flow in one pass.

1. Load and validate the config.
2. Run the crypto self-tests (`runLoginCryptoSelfTests()` + `runGameCryptoSelfTests()`) once,
   before any socket I/O. A red check — round-trip or KAT — stops the run here.
3. Connect to the login server, authenticate, and obtain the session ids + game server
   host/port.
4. Open a fresh game connection with that session data, select the character, and enter the
   world.
5. Answer server pings for 60 seconds, then close the socket cleanly and exit 0. The `IN_GAME` line
   is printed by the **game stage**, on `UserInfo` (see `### PART B`) — `index.ts` must not print it
   a second time. It is the success marker of the whole run, so exactly one occurrence.

`index.ts` owns the shared `statePath`, the single `report(...)` call and the whole-run watchdog of
`## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS`. If any step fails (crypto self-test, `LoginFail`/`PlayFail`, a timeout, or
the server closing the socket before `UserInfo`), stop, print the report with `status: FAIL` exactly
once, and exit non-zero. On success call `report(statePath, artifacts)` **without** a `notes`
argument — a non-empty `notes` turns the status into `FAIL`.

---

## OPCODE MAP (CRITICAL — HighFive)

This is the **HighFive (protocol 267)** opcode set. Put these in `src/game/Opcodes.ts`.

### Login Server opcodes

Direction reads the same way as in the game table below: `→` is client → server (the client writes
it), `←` is server → client (the client parses it).

| Dir | Name               | Opcode |
| --- | ------------------ | ------ |
| ←   | Init               | `0x00` |
| →   | RequestGGAuth      | `0x07` |
| ←   | GGAuth             | `0x0B` |
| →   | RequestAuthLogin   | `0x00` |
| ←   | LoginOk            | `0x03` |
| ←   | LoginFail          | `0x01` |
| →   | RequestServerList  | `0x05` |
| ←   | ServerList         | `0x04` |
| →   | RequestServerLogin | `0x02` |
| ←   | PlayOk             | `0x07` |
| ←   | PlayFail           | `0x06` |

### Game Server opcodes (HighFive)

| Step | Name                   | Dir | Opcode                         |
| ---- | ---------------------- | --- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | ProtocolVersion        | →   | `0x0E`                         |
| 2    | CryptInit              | ←   | `0x2E`                         |
| 3    | AuthRequest            | →   | `0x2B`                         |
| 4    | CharSelectInfo         | ←   | `0x09`                         |
| 5    | CharacterSelected      | →   | `0x12`                         |
| 6    | CharSelected (confirm) | ←   | `0x0B`                         |
| 7    | RequestKeyMapping      | →   | `0x21` (sent as `0xD0 0x0021`) |
| 8    | EnterWorld             | →   | `0x11`                         |
| 9    | UserInfo               | ←   | `0x32`                         |
| -    | NetPingRequest         | ←   | `0xD3` or `0xFE 0x00D3`        |
| -    | NetPing (pong)         | →   | `0xA8`                         |

> Extended opcodes: the client prefixes its extended packets with `0xD0` followed by a 2-byte
> little-endian sub-opcode (e.g., `RequestKeyMapping` is sent as `0xD0 0x0021`). The server may also
> send extended packets prefixed with `0xFE`; treat `0xFE 0x00D3` as a valid `NetPingRequest`.
> Store `ExtendedOpcode = 0xD0` and `ServerExtendedOpcode = 0xFE` alongside the opcode map.

> The first packet after `ProtocolVersion` is always `CryptInit 0x2E`; read its XOR key and flag,
> then init `GameCrypt` per HARD CONSTRAINTS #7 before reading anything else.

### `src/game/Opcodes.ts` — COPY VERBATIM

A `const … as const` object (never an `enum` — see PROJECT SETUP runner note). Some login
values collide by number (e.g. `RequestGGAuth` and `PlayOk` are both `0x07`), so keep the
`in` / `out` split. Every value is a single byte **except** `game.out.RequestKeyMapping`, which is
a 2-byte sub-opcode written with `writeUInt16LE` after the `0xD0` prefix.

```typescript
// HighFive (protocol 267) opcode map. Values are bytes unless noted.
export const OPCODES = {
  login: {
    in: {
      Init: 0x00,
      GGAuth: 0x0b,
      LoginOk: 0x03,
      LoginFail: 0x01,
      ServerList: 0x04,
      PlayOk: 0x07,
      PlayFail: 0x06,
    },
    out: {
      RequestGGAuth: 0x07,
      RequestAuthLogin: 0x00,
      RequestServerList: 0x05,
      RequestServerLogin: 0x02,
    },
  },
  game: {
    in: {
      CryptInit: 0x2e,
      CharSelectInfo: 0x09,
      CharSelected: 0x0b,
      UserInfo: 0x32,
      NetPingRequest: 0xd3, // also arrives as 0xFE 0x00D3
    },
    out: {
      ProtocolVersion: 0x0e,
      AuthRequest: 0x2b,
      CharacterSelected: 0x12,
      RequestKeyMapping: 0x0021, // uint16LE sub-opcode: sent as 0xD0 + writeUInt16LE(0x0021)
      EnterWorld: 0x11,
      NetPing: 0xa8,
    },
  },
} as const;

export const ExtendedOpcode = 0xd0; // client extended-packet prefix
export const ServerExtendedOpcode = 0xfe; // server extended-packet prefix
```

## REUSABLE CODE — COPY VERBATIM

These are correct, working implementations. Copy them into the listed files. You only need to
**wire them into the flow**; do not rewrite the algorithms.

### `src/types.ts` (shared types — the only home for cross-module types)

```typescript
// The single source of shared types. config.ts, net/, login/, game/, debug/ and index.ts
// all import from here, always as `import type { … } from "../types.ts"` — verbatimModuleSyntax
// is on, so a value import of a type is a hard TS1484 error.
// login/ and game/ must NOT import from each other — anything they both need lives in this file
// and is threaded through index.ts. The ONE exception: login/LoginClient.ts imports OPCODES from
// game/Opcodes.ts, because that file holds the whole opcode map, the login opcodes included.

export interface Config {
  loginIp: string;
  loginPort: number;
  gamePort: number;
  // Optional L2_GAME_IP override. Empty/absent (the normal case) = use the ServerList ip.
  gameIp?: string;
  username: string;
  password: string;
  serverId: number;
  charSlot: number;
  protocol: number;
}

// Resolved by the login stage, carried in memory into the game stage. gameHost/gamePort come
// from the picked ServerList record; L2_GAME_PORT is only the fallback for an unusable port.
export interface LoginResult {
  loginOkId1: number;
  loginOkId2: number;
  playOkId1: number;
  playOkId2: number;
  gameHost: string;
  gamePort: number;
}

// What runGame() needs: the login result plus the account name for AuthRequest.
export type GameInput = LoginResult & { username: string };

// key=value session data printed in the final report.
export type Artifacts = Record<string, string | number>;

export type LoginState =
  | "WAIT_INIT"
  | "WAIT_GG_AUTH"
  | "WAIT_LOGIN_OK"
  | "WAIT_SERVER_LIST"
  | "WAIT_PLAY_OK";

export type GameState =
  | "WAIT_CRYPT_INIT"
  | "WAIT_CHAR_LIST"
  | "WAIT_CHAR_SELECTED"
  | "WAIT_USER_INFO"
  | "IN_GAME";

export type AnyState = "IDLE" | LoginState | GameState;
```

### `src/net/PacketReader.ts`

```typescript
// Little-endian binary reader over a Buffer. Advances an internal position as it reads.
export class PacketReader {
  private buf: Buffer;
  private pos: number;

  constructor(buf: Buffer, pos = 0) {
    this.buf = buf;
    this.pos = pos;
  }

  readUInt8(): number {
    const v = this.buf.readUInt8(this.pos);
    this.pos += 1;
    return v;
  }

  readUInt16LE(): number {
    const v = this.buf.readUInt16LE(this.pos);
    this.pos += 2;
    return v;
  }

  readInt16LE(): number {
    const v = this.buf.readInt16LE(this.pos);
    this.pos += 2;
    return v;
  }

  readInt32LE(): number {
    const v = this.buf.readInt32LE(this.pos);
    this.pos += 4;
    return v;
  }

  readInt64LE(): bigint {
    const v = this.buf.readBigInt64LE(this.pos);
    this.pos += 8;
    return v;
  }

  readFloatLE(): number {
    const v = this.buf.readFloatLE(this.pos);
    this.pos += 4;
    return v;
  }

  readDoubleLE(): number {
    const v = this.buf.readDoubleLE(this.pos);
    this.pos += 8;
    return v;
  }

  // Returns a COPY of the next n bytes.
  readBytes(n: number): Buffer {
    const out = Buffer.from(this.buf.subarray(this.pos, this.pos + n));
    this.pos += n;
    return out;
  }

  // UTF-16LE up to (and consuming) the two-byte 0x0000 terminator.
  readStringUTF16(): string {
    let end = this.pos;
    while (end + 1 < this.buf.length && !(this.buf[end] === 0 && this.buf[end + 1] === 0)) {
      end += 2;
    }
    const s = this.buf.toString("utf16le", this.pos, end);
    this.pos = end + 2;
    return s;
  }

  remaining(): number {
    return this.buf.length - this.pos;
  }

  skip(n: number): this {
    this.pos += n;
    return this;
  }
}
```

### `src/net/PacketWriter.ts`

```typescript
// Little-endian binary writer. Accumulates chunks; toBuffer() concatenates them.
// Every mutator returns `this` for chaining.
export class PacketWriter {
  private chunks: Buffer[] = [];

  writeUInt8(v: number): this {
    const b = Buffer.alloc(1);
    b.writeUInt8(v & 0xff, 0);
    this.chunks.push(b);
    return this;
  }

  writeUInt16LE(v: number): this {
    const b = Buffer.alloc(2);
    b.writeUInt16LE(v & 0xffff, 0);
    this.chunks.push(b);
    return this;
  }

  writeInt32LE(v: number): this {
    const b = Buffer.alloc(4);
    b.writeInt32LE(v | 0, 0);
    this.chunks.push(b);
    return this;
  }

  writeInt64LE(v: bigint): this {
    const b = Buffer.alloc(8);
    b.writeBigInt64LE(v, 0);
    this.chunks.push(b);
    return this;
  }

  writeBytes(b: Buffer | Uint8Array): this {
    this.chunks.push(Buffer.from(b));
    return this;
  }

  writeStringNullUTF16(s: string): this {
    this.chunks.push(Buffer.from(s, "utf16le"));
    this.chunks.push(Buffer.from([0x00, 0x00]));
    return this;
  }

  toBuffer(): Buffer {
    return Buffer.concat(this.chunks);
  }
}
```

### `src/net/Connection.ts` (TCP + packet reassembly)

```typescript
import { Socket } from "node:net";

export class Connection {

### `src/debug/DebugTools.ts` (self-debug toolkit) — COPY VERBATIM

Copy this module as-is; only its imports may need path tweaks to match your `src/` layout.
It depends on **nothing but `src/types.ts`**, so create it together with the scaffold, before the
crypto modules exist. The `modulus is 128 bytes` and `charCount >= 1` checks are `check(...)` calls
made from the FSM code during the socket phase — they feed the same counters and that is expected.

```typescript
import type { Artifacts } from "../types.ts";

let passed = 0;
let failed = 0;

// Truthy cond -> "[ok] name" and passed++. Falsy -> "[FAIL] name" and failed++.
export function check(name: string, cond: unknown): boolean {
  if (cond) {
    console.log(`[ok] ${name}`);
    passed += 1;
    return true;
  }
  console.log(`[FAIL] ${name}`);
  failed += 1;
  return false;
}

export function selfTestCounts(): { passed: number; failed: number } {
  return { passed, failed };
}

export function logState(from: string, to: string): void {
  console.log(`[STATE] ${from} -> ${to}`);
}

export function assertState<T>(actual: T, expected: T, ctx: string): void {
  if (actual !== expected) {
    throw new Error(`bad state in ${ctx}: expected ${String(expected)}, got ${String(actual)}`);
  }
}

// The single final report. status is PASS only when nothing failed and no error was passed in.
export function report(statePath: string[], artifacts: Artifacts, notes?: string): void {
  const total = passed + failed;
  const status = failed === 0 && !notes ? "PASS" : "FAIL";
  const arts = Object.entries(artifacts)
    .map(([k, v]) => `${k}=${v}`)
    .join(" ");
  console.log("=== REPORT ===");
  console.log(`status: ${status}`);
  console.log(`self-tests: ${passed}/${total}`);
  console.log(`state-path: ${statePath.join(" -> ")}`);
  console.log(`artifacts: ${arts}`);
  console.log(`notes: ${notes ?? ""}`);
}

export const DebugTools = { check, selfTestCounts, logState, assertState, report };
```

> **`notes` is the failure channel, not a log line.** `report()` prints `status: PASS` only when
> `failed === 0` **and** `notes` is empty — passing an informational string ("kept alive 60s")
> silently turns a successful run into `FAIL`. On success call `report(statePath, artifacts)` with
> no third argument; put only the first failing assertion or error message in `notes`.

> **`assertState` guards transitions, never incoming packets.** Use it to assert the state a
> handler runs in on the happy path. Do **not** use it to reject an unexpected opcode: out-of-order
> and unknown packets are legitimate here and are handled by the tolerance rule in `### PART B`.
> An `assertState` used as a packet filter turns every documented edge case (skipped `GGAuth`,
> skipped `CharSelected`) into a crash.

### `src/crypto/selfTests.ts` (crypto self-tests) — COPY VERBATIM

Run **both** functions once at startup, **before any socket I/O**. They live next to the crypto they
exercise and report through `check(...)`, so they feed the same counters the final report prints.

Each module is checked twice. A **round-trip** (`decrypt(encrypt(x)) === x`) proves only that the two
directions agree — it stays green under any *symmetric* transcription error, which is exactly how a
broken Blowfish reaches a live socket. A **KAT** (known-answer vector) compares against the hex the
reference implementation produces, so a single wrong constant goes red in milliseconds without a
network. The hex below is authoritative: if a KAT fails, the module it exercises was not copied
verbatim — re-copy it. **Never make a KAT pass by editing the expected hex.**

```typescript
import { blowfishEncrypt, blowfishDecrypt } from "./Blowfish.ts";
import { LoginCrypt } from "./LoginCrypt.ts";
import { GameCrypt } from "./GameCrypt.ts";
import { check } from "../debug/DebugTools.ts";

// Two kinds of assertion live here:
//   * round-trip  — decrypt(encrypt(x)) === x. Stays GREEN under any symmetric mistake.
//   * KAT         — a known-answer vector produced by the reference implementation.
// A red KAT means the module it exercises was not copied verbatim. Re-copy it from this
// prompt; never "fix" a KAT by editing the expected hex.

export function runLoginCryptoSelfTests(): void {
  const key = Buffer.from("0123456789abcdef", "ascii"); // 16 bytes
  const block = Buffer.from("deadbeefdeadbeef", "ascii"); // 16 bytes = two ECB blocks
  const bf = blowfishEncrypt(block, key);
  check("blowfish round-trip", blowfishDecrypt(bf, key).equals(block));
  check("blowfish KAT", bf.toString("hex") === "c098ec6e4364c276c098ec6e4364c276");

  const lc = new LoginCrypt();
  lc.setSessionKey(key);
  const body = Buffer.from([0x07, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05]);

  const restored = lc.decrypt(enc);
  check("logincrypt round-trip", restored.subarray(0, body.length).equals(body));
  check("logincrypt KAT", enc.toString("hex") === "98aaaa188a3f0106b6f859365480d8bd");

  // decryptInit over a deterministic body: raw[i] = (i * 7 + 3) & 0xff, 184 bytes.
  // Not a real Init packet — it pins static-key Blowfish + decXORPass + the 8-byte drop.
  const initBody = Buffer.alloc(184);
  for (let i = 0; i < initBody.length; i++) initBody[i] = (i * 7 + 3) & 0xff;
  const init = new LoginCrypt().decryptInit(initBody);

  const c1 = a.encrypt(Buffer.from(m1));

  // The key shifts by the size of every processed packet: the 2nd vector differs from the 1st.
  check("game-xor KAT (2nd packet)", c2.toString("hex") === "1013121514171619");
  check("game-xor round-trip (2nd packet)", b.decrypt(c2).equals(m2));

  // A 20-byte packet is the only vector that exercises all 16 key bytes, the static tail
  // included: for a body shorter than 9 bytes, key[8..15] is never reached.
  const d = new GameCrypt();
  const e = new GameCrypt();
  d.init(xorKey, true);
  e.init(xorKey, true);
  const m3 = Buffer.alloc(20);
  for (let i = 0; i < m3.length; i++) m3[i] = (i * 3 + 1) & 0xff;
  const c3 = d.encrypt(Buffer.from(m3));
  check(
    "game-xor KAT (static tail)",
    c3.toString("hex") === "0006020c04120618c9f27e5dd99d873e0e380c32",
  );
  check("game-xor round-trip (static tail)", e.decrypt(c3).equals(m3));

  const c = new GameCrypt();
  c.init(xorKey, false);
  const plain = Buffer.from([0xaa, 0xbb, 0xcc]);
  check("game-xor disabled passthrough", c.encrypt(Buffer.from(plain)).equals(plain));
}
```

### `src/selftest.ts` — COPY VERBATIM

The crypto gate on its own. `npm run selftest` runs every round-trip and every KAT and opens no
socket, so "crypto green before any socket I/O" can be verified **before `index.ts` exists** —
which is the order `## REUSABLE CODE` demands. `index.ts` keeps its own self-test call; this file
does not replace it.

```typescript
import {
  runLoginCryptoSelfTests,
  runGameCryptoSelfTests,
} from "./crypto/selfTests.ts";
import { selfTestCounts } from "./debug/DebugTools.ts";

runLoginCryptoSelfTests();
runGameCryptoSelfTests();
const { passed, failed } = selfTestCounts();
console.log(`self-tests: ${passed}/${passed + failed}`);
if (failed !== 0) process.exit(1);
```

A green gate prints `self-tests: 12/12` here — the 12 crypto checks and nothing else. The two
socket-phase `check(...)` calls described below fire only during a real run, which is how
`npm run dev` reaches `14/14`.

Final report format printed by `report(...)`:

```
=== REPORT ===
status: PASS | FAIL
self-tests: <passed>/<total>
state-path: IDLE -> ... -> <final>
artifacts: <key=value session data>
notes: <first failing assertion / error, if any>
```

`artifacts` has a **fixed minimum set of keys**, so reports from different runs of this prompt are
comparable. Print at least these, space-separated `key=value`, in this order: `gameHost`,
`gamePort`, `serverId`, `charCount`, `ggSkipped` (`true`/`false`), `encryptionFlag`,
`pingsAnswered`. Extra keys may follow; a missing one is a defect. Never put credentials there.

`statePath` is initialized by `index.ts` as `["IDLE"]`, and each stage pushes a state when it
**enters** it — so a successful run prints
`state-path: IDLE -> WAIT_INIT -> … -> WAIT_USER_INFO -> IN_GAME`. The `state-path` is the happy
path used for reporting; it may still include states that the server skipped (e.g.,
`WAIT_LOGIN_OK` when `GGAuth` is skipped). Run
`runLoginCryptoSelfTests()` + `runGameCryptoSelfTests()` (imported from `crypto/selfTests`) once at
startup, **before any socket I/O**. **If any of them fails — round-trip or KAT — stop and print the
report**; do not open sockets over red crypto.

Exactly two more `check(...)` calls fire later, during the socket phase, and they feed the same
`self-tests: X/Y` counter: `check('modulus is 128 bytes', unscrambledModulus.length === 128)` once
the modulus is unscrambled (`unscrambleModulus` already throws on a wrong length, so this one only
records the fact) and `check('charCount >= 1', charCount >= 1)` after `CharSelectInfo`. Those two
are the whole list — do not invent further runtime checks, and do not move the crypto ones into the
socket phase. A full green run therefore prints `self-tests: 14/14`.

## MODULE CONTRACTS

The exact exported surface each module must expose. Wire the modules to these signatures so
cross-module calls typecheck on the first `tsc` pass. **Shared types come only from
`src/types.ts`, always through `import type` (see the `verbatimModuleSyntax` note in
`## PROJECT SETUP`); `login/` and `game/` never import from each other — with one exception:
`login/LoginClient.ts` imports `OPCODES` from `game/Opcodes.ts`, because that file holds the
whole opcode map, the login opcodes included.**

| Module | Exports (signature) |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| `types.ts` | `Config`, `LoginResult`, `GameInput`, `Artifacts`, `LoginState`, `GameState`, `AnyState` (see the verbatim listing) |
| `selftest.ts` | no exports — the `npm run selftest` entry point: runs both crypto suites, prints `self-tests: N/M`, exits non-zero on a red check (verbatim) |
| `config.ts` | `loadConfig(): Config` — reads `.env` via `dotenv`, `parseInt` numbers, throws a clear `Error` on any missing/invalid var (`L2_GAME_IP` is the only optional one) |
| `crypto/Blowfish.ts` | `blowfishEncrypt(data: Buffer, key: Buffer): Buffer`, `blowfishDecrypt(data: Buffer, key: Buffer): Buffer` |
| `crypto/NewCrypt.ts` | `NewCrypt` object: `appendChecksum(raw: Uint8Array): void`, `decXORPass(raw: Uint8Array, key: number): void` |
| `crypto/ScrambledRsaKey.ts` | `unscrambleModulus(scrambled: Buffer): Buffer` |
| `crypto/RsaCrypt.ts` | `encryptCredentials(login: string, password: string, modulus: Buffer): Buffer` |
| `crypto/LoginCrypt.ts` | `class LoginCrypt` — `setSessionKey(k: Buffer): void`, `decryptInit(body: Buffer): Buffer`, `decrypt(body: Buffer): Buffer`, `encrypt(body: Buffer): Buffer` |
| `crypto/GameCrypt.ts` | `class GameCrypt` — `init(xorKey: Buffer, enable: boolean): void`, `isEnabled(): boolean`, `decrypt(data: Buffer): Buffer`, `encrypt(data: Buffer): Buffer` |
| `crypto/selfTests.ts` | `runLoginCryptoSelfTests(): void`, `runGameCryptoSelfTests(): void` (verbatim) |
| `game/Opcodes.ts` | `OPCODES` (`as const`), `ExtendedOpcode`, `ServerExtendedOpcode` |
| `net/Connection.ts` | `class Connection` (verbatim) — `send(body: Buffer): void` prepends the length itself |
| `net/PacketReader.ts` | `class PacketReader` (verbatim) |
| `net/PacketWriter.ts` | `class PacketWriter` (verbatim) |
| `debug/DebugTools.ts` | `check`, `selfTestCounts`, `logState`, `assertState`, `report` (verbatim); imports only `src/types.ts` |
| `login/LoginClient.ts` | `runLogin(cfg: Config, statePath: string[]): Promise<LoginResult>` |
| `game/GameClient.ts` | `runGame(cfg: Config, input: GameInput, statePath: string[]): Promise<Artifacts>` |
| `index.ts` | `main(): Promise<void>` (invoked at module load); owns the shared `statePath: string[]` |

## PACKET PIPELINE

Framing, crypto and parsing meet in exactly one place. Get this wrong and every field reads two
bytes off — which looks exactly like broken crypto and sends you to the wrong part of
`## TROUBLESHOOTING`.

**Receive.** `Connection.onPacket(frame)` hands you the **whole frame, length prefix included**:

```typescript
// frame = [uint16LE size][body], where body is encrypted-or-plain per the table below
const body = frame.subarray(2);     // 1. the size field is never encrypted - drop it
const plain = decryptBody(body);    // 2. stage-specific, see the table
const r = new PacketReader(plain);  // 3. parse from the START of the body
const opcode = r.readUInt8();       // 4. "Off 0" in PROTOCOL REFERENCE is THIS byte
```

| Stage | Which packet            | `decryptBody` is                                          |
| ----- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Login | the first one (`Init`)  | `loginCrypt.decryptInit(body)`                            |
| Login | every packet after it   | `loginCrypt.decrypt(body)` (identity until `setSessionKey`) |
| Game  | `CryptInit`             | nothing — this body is always plaintext                   |
| Game  | every packet after it   | `gameCrypt.decrypt(body)` (identity while the flag was 0) |

**Send.** Build the body with `PacketWriter` — opcode + payload, **no length** — encrypt it, then
hand it to `send()`, which prepends the length itself:

```typescript
const body = new PacketWriter().writeUInt8(OPCODES.game.out.AuthRequest)/* … */.toBuffer();
conn.send(gameCrypt.encrypt(body)); // send() writes [uint16LE body.length + 2][body]
```

Invariants, in the order they are usually broken:

- The 2-byte length is **never** encrypted, in either direction, in either stage. It is measured on
  the encrypted body.
- Every offset in `## PROTOCOL REFERENCE` is counted from the opcode byte = 0, i.e. from the
  **decrypted body** — never from the frame.
- `Connection.send()` prepends the length. Doing it yourself gives a double prefix, and the server
  drops you without a word.
- Blowfish is ECB without padding: any body handed to it must be a multiple of 8. A login body that
  is not (`body.length % 8 !== 0`) is a framing bug — fail with that length in `notes` rather than
  letting `blowfishDecrypt` throw.
- A client extended packet carries its `uint16LE` sub-opcode **inside** the body:
  `[0xD0][uint16LE sub][payload]`. A server extended packet arrives as `[0xFE][uint16LE sub][…]`.
- **Decrypt every received body exactly once, in arrival order — including the ones you ignore.**
  `GameCrypt` holds two independently shifting keys that advance by the size of each processed body,
  so skipping the decryption of an unknown packet (or decrypting one twice) desynchronizes the
  stream permanently: tolerating a packet means decrypt → look at the opcode → drop, never drop
  before decrypting.

## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS

Every wait in this client is bounded, so a mistake surfaces as a named failure in seconds instead
of a silent 60-second hang. These numbers are part of the spec — use them as written.

| Wait                                        | Budget | On expiry                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| TCP connect (each of the two connections)   | 10 s   | FAIL, `notes = connect timeout <host>:<port>`  |
| any `WAIT_*` state expecting a server packet| 15 s   | FAIL, `notes = timeout in <state>`             |
| `WAIT_GG_AUTH` specifically                 | 3 s    | **not** a failure — see below                  |
| reaching `IN_GAME` (whole-run watchdog)     | 45 s   | FAIL, `notes = watchdog: <last state>`         |
| keepalive after `IN_GAME`                   | 60 s   | success: close the socket, report PASS, exit 0 |

- **`WAIT_GG_AUTH` is the special case.** A server that does not use GameGuard answers
  `RequestGGAuth` with *nothing at all* — the stall is silence, not a surprise packet. Send
  `RequestGGAuth`, then wait up to 3 s for `GGAuth 0x0B`. If those 3 s pass with no packet, **or** a
  packet arrives whose opcode is not `0x0B`, treat GG as skipped: set `ggResponse = 0`, log the
  transition and continue with `RequestAuthLogin`. **This rule overrides the unknown-packet
  tolerance of `### PART A`** — a surprise packet here is a state exit, not something to drop. The
  order is fixed: first leave the state (`ggResponse = 0`, log the transition, send
  `RequestAuthLogin`), **then** re-dispatch the packet in `WAIT_LOGIN_OK`, so a `LoginFail 0x01`
  arriving here is handled as the failure it is instead of being discarded. (`LoginOk` cannot arrive
  before `RequestAuthLogin` has been sent, so never make the exit from this state depend on it.)
- **The per-state 15 s budget is a no-progress timer, not a deadline.** Restart it on every frame
  the client successfully parses in that state — an unknown packet it drops and a ping it answers
  included. Only 15 s of total silence is a timeout. A loaded server can take well over 15 s to get
  from `EnterWorld` to `UserInfo` while sending traffic the whole time; that is a healthy
  connection, not a failure.
- **The 45 s watchdog is a hard global ceiling, deliberately tighter than the sum of the per-state
  budgets.** Those budgets bound one silent state; the watchdog bounds the whole run. Summing them
  (≈150 s) is not the contract — whichever fires first ends the run, and the watchdog is what makes
  "a failing run ends within 45 s" true.
- The 60 s keepalive is measured **from the moment `IN_GAME` is printed**, not from process start.
  A successful run is therefore a little over 60 s long; a failing one ends within 45 s.
- Every exit path settles its stage promise exactly **once**: success, `LoginFail`/`PlayFail`, a
  timeout, the socket `error` event, or `onClose` arriving before `UserInfo`. The verbatim
  `Connection` only logs socket errors and then calls `onClose`, so the FSM must treat `onClose` as
  terminal: if the stage has not resolved yet, reject. A promise left pending is a run that hangs
  until the watchdog with nothing useful in the report.
- Clear every timer you created (per-state timeout, watchdog, keepalive) before resolving — a live
  timer keeps the event loop alive and the process will not exit on its own.

## PROTOCOL REFERENCE (field-by-field)

Field types: `C`=uint8 (1), `H`=uint16LE (2), `D`=int32LE (4), `Q`=int64LE (8), `S`=UTF-16LE
null-terminated string, `b[n]`=`n` raw bytes.

### PART A — LOGIN SERVER

Flow: `Init → RequestGGAuth → GGAuth → RequestAuthLogin → LoginOk → RequestServerList →
ServerList → RequestServerLogin → PlayOk`.

`LoginClient` FSM states: `WAIT_INIT → WAIT_GG_AUTH → WAIT_LOGIN_OK → WAIT_SERVER_LIST →
WAIT_PLAY_OK`. Log every transition via `logState`; `assertState` guards the transition, never the
incoming opcode (see the note under `### src/debug/DebugTools.ts`). Decode every frame through
`## PACKET PIPELINE` and bound every wait per `## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS`. Tolerate up to 10 unknown
packets per entry into a state here too — the counter resets on every transition: log the opcode and
drop it; the 11th within one entry is a FAIL with the opcode and the state in `notes`. The one place
this rule yields is `WAIT_GG_AUTH`, where the 3 s rule of `## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS` takes
precedence: a non-`0x0B` packet there is not an unknown packet to drop, it is the signal that GG was
skipped.

**Init (← `0x00`)** — first packet, special crypto (`LoginCrypt.decryptInit`). After decrypt, read:

| Off | Type   | Field                                                 |
| --- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | C      | opcode `0x00`                                         |
| 1   | D      | sessionId                                             |
| 5   | D      | protocol revision                                     |
| 9   | b[128] | scrambled RSA modulus → run `unscrambleModulus`       |
| 137 | b[16]  | unknown (skip)                                        |
| 153 | b[16]  | **Blowfish session key** → `LoginCrypt.setSessionKey` |

Call `setSessionKey` **while still handling `Init`**, before anything is sent. Every client→server
login packet from `RequestGGAuth` onwards is Blowfish-encrypted with that key; a key installed one
packet too late means the first outgoing packet leaves in clear text and the server drops you.

**RequestGGAuth (→ `0x07`)**: `C 0x07` + `D sessionId` + `b[16]` GG constants
(`0x00000123, 0x00004567, 0x000089AB, 0x0000CDEF` as four `D`, i.e. the bytes
`23 01 00 00 67 45 00 00 ab 89 00 00 ef cd 00 00`) + `b[19]` zeros — a 40-byte body before
encryption. Many servers skip GGAuth entirely and answer with **silence**: the 3-second rule in
`## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS` is how you leave `WAIT_GG_AUTH`.

**GGAuth (← `0x0B`)**: `C 0x0B` + `D response` (keep `response`).

**RequestAuthLogin (→ `0x00`)**: `C 0x00` + `b[128]` = `encryptCredentials(username, password,
unscrambledModulus)` + `D ggResponse` + the fixed 43-byte GG block:

```
23 01 00 00 67 45 00 00 ab 89 00 00 ef cd 00 00 08 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

**LoginOk (← `0x03`)**: `C 0x03` + `D loginOkId1` + `D loginOkId2`. (`LoginFail 0x01` + `C reason`
means stop.)

**RequestServerList (→ `0x05`)**: `C 0x05` + `D loginOkId1` + `D loginOkId2` + `D 0x04000000`.
The last field is the `int32LE` **value** `0x04000000`, which puts the bytes `00 00 00 04` on the
wire — write the value, not the dump. Example body before encryption, with
`loginOkId1 = 0x11111111` and `loginOkId2 = 0x22222222`: `05 11111111 22222222 00000004`
(13 bytes). `RequestServerLogin` with `serverId = 2` is `02 11111111 22222222 02` (10 bytes). The
2-byte length prefix is added by `send()` **after** `LoginCrypt.encrypt` has padded the body, so it
is larger than these numbers.

**ServerList (← `0x04`)**: `C 0x04` + `C serverCount` + `C 0x00`, then `serverCount` records:
`C id` + `b[4] ip` + `D port` + `C ageLimit` + `C pvp` + `H online` + `H maxPlayers` +
`C status` + `D 0` + `C 0`. **Each record is exactly 21 bytes** — if the reader sits anywhere else
after one record, the whole rest of the list is garbage. Pick the record where
`id == L2_SERVER_ID`; if nothing matches, that is a FAIL listing the ids you did find in `notes` —
never silently fall back to the first record.

`b[4] ip` are the four octets in order, so
`gameHost = ip[0] + "." + ip[1] + "." + ip[2] + "." + ip[3]`. The little-endian rule of HARD
CONSTRAINTS #2 covers integers, **not** these four bytes: read them with `readBytes(4)`, never as a
`D`, or the address comes out reversed.

`gamePort` is the record's `D port`. `L2_GAME_PORT` from `.env` is only the fallback for when that
value is unusable (`0` or absent).

`L2_GAME_IP` is an **optional** escape hatch for `gameHost`: when it is set and non-empty, use it
instead of the record's ip and log that you overrode it. Test and private servers often advertise
`127.0.0.1` or an internal address in their server list, which is unreachable from wherever this
client actually runs, and without an override such a run has no way to finish. When `L2_GAME_IP` is
unset — the normal case — the record's ip wins and there is still no other fallback.

**RequestServerLogin (→ `0x02`)**: `C 0x02` + `D loginOkId1` + `D loginOkId2` + `C serverId`.

**PlayOk (← `0x07`)**: `C 0x07` + `D playOkId1` + `D playOkId2`. (`PlayFail 0x06` means stop.)

The four session ids are read with `readInt32LE` and written back with `writeInt32LE` —
`PacketReader`/`PacketWriter` have no unsigned 32-bit helpers, on purpose. The bits round-trip
exactly, which is all the server cares about, so an id may legitimately appear as a **negative**
number in a log or in `artifacts`. That is correct; do not "fix" it with a hand-rolled unsigned
read, which is how a correct value becomes a wrong one.

**Carry forward to the game stage:** `loginOkId1`, `loginOkId2`, `playOkId1`, `playOkId2`, and
`gameHost`/`gamePort` from the picked record. Then close the login connection. The game stage
receives this object in memory (`GameInput`) — nothing is written to disk.

### PART B — GAME SERVER (flag-driven 16-byte shifting XOR)

> Connect to the game host/port. ProtocolVersion is sent raw; after CryptInit apply game encryption
> per HARD CONSTRAINTS #7.

Flow: `→ ProtocolVersion | CryptInit ← | → AuthRequest | CharSelectInfo ← | → CharacterSelected |
CharSelected ← | → RequestKeyMapping + EnterWorld | UserInfo ← ⇒ IN_GAME | (loop) ping/pong`.

`GameClient` FSM states: `WAIT_CRYPT_INIT → WAIT_CHAR_LIST → WAIT_CHAR_SELECTED →
WAIT_USER_INFO → IN_GAME`. Log every transition via `logState`; `assertState` guards the transition,
never the incoming opcode. Decode every frame through `## PACKET PIPELINE` and bound every wait per
`## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS`.

**Unknown packets.** The server sends plenty of packets this client has no use for, and it sends
them in **every** state — not only around character selection. Decrypt the body, log the opcode,
drop it. The budget is **10 unknown packets per entry into a state**: the counter resets on every
transition, so a state entered twice gets a fresh 10. The 11th within one entry is a FAIL carrying
that opcode and the state in `notes`.

Two states are **exempt from the counter entirely**: `WAIT_USER_INFO` and `IN_GAME`. Between
`EnterWorld` and `UserInfo` a HighFive server routinely sends dozens of packets this client
ignores (quest list, SSQ info, macro list, skill list, `0xFE` sub-packets), so a budget of 10 there
would fail a correct client against a correct server. In those two states drop every unexpected
packet silently and do not count it.

A ping is **never** an unknown packet: answer it per the keepalive rule below, in any state from
`WAIT_CRYPT_INIT` onwards, and do not count it.

Dropping a body **before** decrypting it desynchronizes `GameCrypt` for the rest of the session —
see the last invariant in `## PACKET PIPELINE`.

**ProtocolVersion (→ `0x0E`)**: `C 0x0E` + `D L2_PROTOCOL`. Sent immediately on connect, **raw**
(no game encryption yet). Complete frame for protocol 267: `07 00 0e 0b 01 00 00`.

**CryptInit (← `0x2E`)** — first packet from server, and the one packet where a single byte of
drift ruins the whole session: get `xorKey` one byte off and every later packet decodes as noise.
Offsets in the **body** (after `frame.subarray(2)`; this body is **not** encrypted):

| Off | Type   | Field                                                           |
| --- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | C      | opcode `0x2E`                                                   |
| 1   | C      | status (protocol accepted; **this byte exists — do not skip it**) |
| 2   | b[8]   | `xorKey` → `gameCrypt.init(xorKey, …)`                          |
| 10  | D      | `encryptionFlag` (non-zero ⇒ enable the cipher)                  |
| 14  | …      | rest, ignore                                                    |

Complete frame for `status = 1`, `xorKey = 01..08` and flag `1` — a 14-byte body in a 16-byte
frame: `1000 2e 01 0102030405060708 01000000`. Call
`gameCrypt.init(xorKey, encryptionFlag !== 0)` and apply encryption per HARD CONSTRAINTS #7.

This body is plaintext and arrives **before** `init`, so it never passes through `GameCrypt` and
must **not** shift the key: the first body the cipher ever touches is the `AuthRequest` you send
next. Feeding `CryptInit` through `decrypt()` desynchronizes both keys by 14 bytes for the rest of
the run.

**AuthRequest (→ `0x2B`)** — encrypted only when the CryptInit flag was non-zero (see HARD CONSTRAINTS
#7): `C 0x2B` + `S username` + `D playOkId2` + `D playOkId1` + `D loginOkId1` + `D loginOkId2`.
HighFive has no trailing language field. Example frame for username `qwerty`,
`loginOkId1/2 = 0x11111111/0x22222222`, `playOkId1/2 = 0x33333333/0x44444444` and encryption flag
`0`: `2100 2b 710077006500720074007900 0000 44444444 33333333 11111111 22222222` — a 31-byte body
in a 33-byte frame. With the flag non-zero the same body is XOR-encrypted and only the length
prefix stays readable.

**CharSelectInfo (← `0x09`)**: `C 0x09` + `D charCount` + per-character data. You only need to
confirm `charCount >= 1` (through `check`) and log the count — do not parse the per-character
block. `L2_CHAR_SLOT` is sent as configured; this client does not validate it against `charCount`.

**CharacterSelected (→ `0x12`)**: `C 0x12` + `D L2_CHAR_SLOT` + `b[14]` zeros.
(The 14 zero bytes are required.) Complete frame for slot 0 with encryption flag `0`:
`1500 12 00000000 0000000000000000000000000000` — a 19-byte body in a 21-byte frame.

**CharSelected confirm (← `0x0B`)**: just the opcode (and char details you can ignore). Some servers
skip this and jump straight to UserInfo — handle both:

- **`0x0B` arrives:** send the enter-world sequence below, move to `WAIT_USER_INFO`, wait for `0x32`.
- **`0x32` arrives instead**, while still in `WAIT_CHAR_SELECTED`: send the enter-world sequence,
  then treat **this same packet** as the `UserInfo` you were going to wait for — print `IN_GAME`
  and go straight to `IN_GAME`. Do **not** afterwards wait for another `0x32`: there will not be
  one, and the 15 s budget of `WAIT_USER_INFO` would expire on a perfectly healthy connection.

Either way the enter-world sequence is sent **at most once per run** — guard it with a flag.

**EnterWorld sequence (→):** send `RequestKeyMapping` as the extended packet `0xD0 0x0021`, then
`EnterWorld 0x11` + `b[104]` zeros (the 104 zero bytes are mandatory). Each of the two is sent **at
most once per run**. Complete frames with encryption flag `0`: `RequestKeyMapping` = `0500 d0 2100`
(3-byte body, 5-byte frame — the sub-opcode is a `uint16LE`, hence `2100` and not `21`);
`EnterWorld` = `6b00 11` followed by 104 zero bytes (105-byte body, 107-byte frame).

**UserInfo (← `0x32`)**: the character is now in the world. **Print `IN_GAME`.** You don't need to
parse its fields for this task.

**Keepalive — NetPingRequest (← `0xD3` or `0xFE 0x00D3`) / NetPing pong (→ `0xA8`):** in
**every** state from `WAIT_CRYPT_INIT` onwards — not only `WAIT_USER_INFO` and `IN_GAME` — a ping
is answered and never counted as an unknown packet. Whenever you receive opcode `0xD3`
(`C 0xD3` + `D pingId`) or the server-extended form `0xFE 0x00D3`
(`C 0xFE` + `H 0x00D3` + `D pingId`), reply with NetPing:
`C 0xA8` + `D pingId` + `D 0x00000000` + `D 0x00080000` — a **13-byte body, 15 bytes on the wire**
once `send()` has prepended the length. Complete frame for `pingId = 1` with encryption flag `0`:
`0f00 a8 01000000 00000000 00000800` (the trailing field is the `int32LE` value `0x00080000`, i.e.
the byte sequence `00 00 08 00`). Keep the process alive for the 60 s of
`## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS`, then close and exit 0.

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING (common failure modes)

- **`npm run dev` dies before printing anything.** Module format. `SyntaxError: Cannot use import
  statement outside a module` means `package.json` still says `"type": "commonjs"`;
  `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for a file that exists means a relative import is missing its `.ts`
  extension. See the module-format note in `## PROJECT SETUP`.
- **`tsc` fails with TS1484 "is a type and must be imported using a type-only import".**
  `verbatimModuleSyntax` is on and `src/types.ts` exports only types. Write
  `import type { Config } from "../types.ts";` — the `type` keyword is mandatory in every module
  that touches a shared type. See the note under `### tsconfig.json`.
- **A KAT is red but its round-trip is green.** The module was not copied verbatim — one constant,
  one offset or one loop bound differs. Re-copy it from `## REUSABLE CODE`; do not edit the
  expected hex, and do not go near a socket until every KAT is green.
- **Blowfish decodes as garbage / round-trip fails.** Verify
  `blowfishDecrypt(blowfishEncrypt(x, k), k).equals(x)` before any socket I/O. Use pure TypeScript
  (no `node:crypto`), 8-byte blocks, ECB, no padding.
- **Init won't decode.** Static-key Blowfish decrypt → `decXORPass` → drop the last 8 bytes. No
  checksum on Init.
- **LoginFail right after AuthLogin.** RSA: unscramble modulus, use `RSA_NO_PADDING`, 128-byte
  plaintext with login at `0x5E` and password at `0x6E` (ASCII).
- **Checksum mismatch / server drops you on login.** Outgoing login packets: pad to 4 bytes, append
  8 zero bytes, pad to 8, write the XOR checksum into the **last 4 bytes** of the padded body, then
  Blowfish-encrypt. Length prefix is measured on the encrypted body.
- **Wrong opcodes / nothing happens on the game server.** You used the textbook L2 opcodes. Use the
  HighFive OPCODE MAP exactly (ProtocolVersion `0x0E`, CryptInit `0x2E`, AuthRequest `0x2B`, …).
- **AuthRequest rejected.** Key order is `playOkId2, playOkId1, loginOkId1, loginOkId2`. No trailing
  language field.
- **CharacterSelected ignored.** You must append exactly 14 zero bytes after the slot index.
- **No UserInfo after EnterWorld / silent disconnect.** You forgot the 104 bytes of padding, or you
  skipped RequestKeyMapping. HighFive enter-world = RequestKeyMapping (`0xD0 0x0021`) then EnterWorld
  `0x11` + `b[104]` zeros.
- **Game packets look scrambled.** Verify `gameCrypt.init(xorKey, flag !== 0)` and
  `decrypt(encrypt(x)).equals(x)`. Static key tail: `c8 27 93 01 a1 6c 31 97`. See HARD CONSTRAINTS
  #7 for flag behavior.
- **Connection closes after a minute.** You aren't answering pings. Reply to every `0xD3` (and the
  server-extended `0xFE 0x00D3`) with the `0xA8` pong (13-byte body, 15-byte frame).
- **`send()` writes garbage / server rejects frames.** `Connection.send(body)` expects the body
  WITHOUT the 2-byte length prefix and prepends it internally. Do not prepend the length yourself.
- **The opcode is wrong and every field is shifted by two bytes.** You parsed the frame instead of
  the body. `onPacket` delivers the length prefix too: `frame.subarray(2)` first, decrypt, then read
  from offset 0. See `## PACKET PIPELINE`.
- **The game stream decodes for a few packets and then turns to noise.** You dropped an unknown
  packet without decrypting it. Both `GameCrypt` keys shift by the size of every body processed, so
  every received body must be decrypted exactly once, in arrival order, even when it is then
  ignored.
- **The run hangs with no further output.** Something is waiting unbounded, or a stage promise was
  never settled. Every state has a 15 s budget, `WAIT_GG_AUTH` has its own 3 s rule, and the run has
  a 45 s watchdog — see `## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS`. `onClose` before `UserInfo` must reject the stage
  promise.
- **The process never exits after the keepalive.** A timer is still armed. Clear the per-state
  timeout, the watchdog and the keepalive timer before resolving.
- **The game host is unreachable / looks reversed.** The `b[4] ip` of a `ServerList` record is four
  octets in order, not an `int32LE`. Read it with `readBytes(4)`.
- **Everything worked but the report says `FAIL`.** `report()` returns `FAIL` whenever `notes` is
  non-empty. Pass `notes` only for an actual failure.
- **Duplicate EnterWorld warning.** If `UserInfo` arrives before `CharSelected`, guard the enter-world
  sequence so it runs at most once.
- **`timeout in WAIT_USER_INFO` although the character clearly entered the world.** Either `0x32`
  arrived while you were still in `WAIT_CHAR_SELECTED` and you went on to wait for a *second* one —
  that packet **was** the `UserInfo` (see `### PART B`) — or your per-state timer is a deadline
  instead of a no-progress timer: it must restart on every frame parsed in the state, dropped and
  ping frames included.
- **`unknown packet budget exhausted in WAIT_USER_INFO`.** That state is exempt from the counter;
  a HighFive server sends dozens of ignorable packets between `EnterWorld` and `UserInfo`.
- **The game stream is noise from the very first packet after `CryptInit`.** Either the `C status`
  byte at offset 1 of `CryptInit` was skipped, so `xorKey` is shifted by one, or the `CryptInit`
  body itself was pushed through `GameCrypt` — it is plaintext, arrives before `init`, and must not
  shift the key.
- **Connection closes before `UserInfo`.** If the server closes the socket while the
  client is still in `WAIT_USER_INFO`, treat it as a failure: settle the promise (reject it
  or resolve with an error — never leave it pending) and print the report with `status: FAIL`.

## FINAL DELIVERABLE

A complete, compiling project. `npx tsc --noEmit` is clean. Running `npm run dev` with the
existing `.env` passes every crypto self-test and KAT without touching the network, connects
end-to-end, prints `IN_GAME`, answers pings for 60 s, prints exactly one `=== REPORT ===` with
`status: PASS`, and exits 0. A failure of any kind ends the same way within the budgets of
`## TIMEOUTS & LIVENESS`: one report, `status: FAIL`, non-zero exit — never a hang. No extra
features.
