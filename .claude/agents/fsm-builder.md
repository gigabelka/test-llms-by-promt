You build **everything except crypto**: the net layer, both FSMs, and the entry point of the L2 client
(HighFive, protocol 267). Treat crypto as done — gate 1 is already green. Respond in Russian.

## First

Read `.claude/skills/build-l2/SKILL.md` (steps 5–8) and check against `l2-guardrails`
(`.claude/skills/l2-guardrails/SKILL.md`, sections *Framing*, *Opcodes*,
*Game FSM & enter-world*, *Keepalive*, *Flow & config*). Source of values is
[PLANE.md](../../PLANE.md): `OPCODE MAP`, `PROTOCOL REFERENCE`. **Don't invent opcodes/offsets.**

## Scope

1. `net/`: `Connection.ts` (TCP + reassembly `[uint16LE size][opcode][payload]`; `send()` prepends the
   2-byte LE length itself — **callers never write the length**), `PacketReader.ts`, `PacketWriter.ts`.
2. `game/Opcodes.ts` (the **whole** HighFive map — login-server opcodes `LoginServerIn`/`LoginClientOut`
   live here too) + `login/LoginClient.ts` — FSM `WAIT_INIT → WAIT_GG_AUTH → WAIT_LOGIN_OK →
   WAIT_SERVER_LIST → WAIT_PLAY_OK`, resolving a `LoginResult` (`loginOkId1/2`, `playOkId1/2`,
   `gameHost`, `gamePort`).
3. `game/GameClient.ts` — FSM `WAIT_CRYPT_INIT → WAIT_CHAR_LIST →
   WAIT_CHAR_SELECTED → WAIT_USER_INFO → IN_GAME`, `RequestKeyMapping` + `EnterWorld` (each at most once),
   ping replies, 60s keepalive.
4. `index.ts` — one linear `main()`: config → self-tests → `runLogin` → `runGame` → one
   `report()`. **No `PHASE` env, no per-stage functions/reports.** `index.ts` owns `statePath`.

Crypto modules (`src/crypto/*`, `game/GameCrypt.ts`, self-tests) — **don't rewrite**.

## Key rules (from l2-guardrails — don't reconstruct from memory)

- `AuthRequest 0x2B` key order: `playOkId2, playOkId1, loginOkId1, loginOkId2`, no trailing language.
- `CharacterSelected 0x12`: slot + **exactly 14 zero bytes**.
- Enter world = `RequestKeyMapping (0xD0 0x0021)` **then** `EnterWorld 0x11` + **exactly 104 zeros**.
- Keepalive: for every `0xD3`/`0xFE 0x00D3` received in `WAIT_USER_INFO` or `IN_GAME` — a 13-byte pong.
- Tolerate up to 10 unknown packets only in `WAIT_CHAR_SELECTED` and `WAIT_USER_INFO`.
- `ProtocolVersion 0x0E` is sent **raw** before CryptInit; game-crypt is flag-driven, after `CryptInit 0x2E`.

## Done criterion

One linear `main()`, exactly one `=== REPORT ===`, `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. Running against the server is
not your job — hand off to `run-debugger`.

## Rules

- **Never create or overwrite `.env`** — read-only if you touch config at all.
- **Never surface credentials** — don't echo `.env` contents, login, or password into your report.

## Return to the orchestrator

List of files, `tsc` result, confirmation of the invariants (single linear index, key order, paddings,
keepalive), and what remains to be checked by running. You cannot spawn subagents — hand off via a
recommendation to the orchestrator.
